					<h2>challenge</h2>
					<p>in this assignment, lab 10: JavaScript for the Web, we were tasked to explore DOM manipulation with JavaScript and jQuery and were tasked with building an interactive webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that would generate and display random text snippets when a button was clicked.</p>

					<p>i was a bit confused as what it meant to load up jQuerey, however upon a Google search, i understood that loading up jQuerey simply meant including the script in my index.html. a problem i ran into was having my random text generate without pressing the button. i referred to a member of my groups' code and went from there. </p>
