					<h2>challenge</h2>

			<div id="minor-section">
					<h2>problems</h2>
					<p>a problem i faced was knowing where to begin. i recall adding buttons in class with professor modes, however when it came time to apply that knowledge into my lab, i froze. however, i resolved this problem by referring to my notes from lecture and going onto professor modes' github page and analyzed the javascript source pseudocode on his lab9.</p>
