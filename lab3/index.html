			<h1>lab 3 - file structures</h1>
			<p> the purpose of lab 3 - file structures was to attempt creating a file structure on my computer and add index.html files. </p>
			<h2>challenges</h2>
			<p>it is still challenging for me to continue to understand how to utilize css tools and understand each tags function and it's order. even this page i still think is a bit ugly, because i'm unsure of the css tools. i think other than that, creating index.html files within the folder was relatively digestible for me.</p>	
			<h2>results</h2>
			<p> this is the index.html file that i made, the page you're looking at right now! </p> 
			
		
			<div id="index.html">
				<img id="indexhtml-file-lab3" class="photo" src="./img/indexhtml-file-lab3.jpg" />
