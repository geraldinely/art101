			<h1>lab 4: pseudocoding and problem-solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>challenge</h2>
					<p>the challenge of this lab was to pseudocode a simple task and a simple computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>problems</h2>
					<p> there were not many problems that arose other than feeling doubt in my pseudocoding. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p> this assignment was a good exercise in mapping out code in a very simple aspect. coding should be well organized and step by step, like pseudocode. this was a method to practice. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>results</h2>
					<div id="output"></div>
<pre><code>
	//Generate a word or phrase for players to guess
		//Print hanger as well as head of character
			//Print blank underscore lines for each letter of secret word or phrase
			//Players take turn guessing letters of the word/phrase or guess the entire phrase
			//For each missed letter/phrase, new part of the character/hangman is drawn
		//Test of win or lose
	//The players win if they guess the entire word before the hangman figure is fully drawn. The Host wins if the hangman is fully drawn (6-7 incorrect guesses) before the players guess the word.
</pre></code>
