  //Print hanger as well as head of character
  //Print blank underscore lines for each letter of secret word or phrase
    //Players take turn guessing letters of the word/phrase or guess the entire phrase
    //For each missed letter/phrase, new part of the character/hangman is drawn
  //Test of win or lose
//The players win if they guess the entire word before the hangman figure is fully drawn. The Host wins if the hangman is fully drawn (6-7 incorrect guesses) before the players guess the word.
