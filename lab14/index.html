                <p> debugging lab 13: loops was a bit daunting at first. on the server, it showed up as lab 11: javascript and forms. i then realized i had not pressed the fetch origin button on my github page, and once doing that, my lab updated to the correct lab and the javascript ran smoothly! </p>
