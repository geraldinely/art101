			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>challenge</h2>
					<p>the challenge of lab 2 was to get our start to HTML and CSS. the task was to acclimate to a texteditor -- being vscode, practice coding in html, create a css file, and seeing it come together in our website.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>problems</h2>
					<p>some problems that arose for me were
						<ul> 
							<li>understanding how to link files</li>
							<li>resizing image on homepage (my cat picture was too big) </li>
							<li>understanding the anchor tags</li>
						</ul> 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>reflection</h2>
					<p>overall, this lab was very engaging and exciting. i especially enjoyed learning about how to style our page, and i look forward to learning how to insert images! </p>
