			<h1>lab 8 - anon functions and callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>challenge</h2>
					<p>the challenge of this lab is to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks. we worked in the javascript console and saw our results in the javascript console, which i thought was pretty cool. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>problems</h2>
					<p>a problem i ran into was trying to link lab8 to my homepage. i also ran into the issue of linking my lab8 js to my index.html. for some reason, the server kept reading the lab7 js -- most likely because i copied and pasted the index.html and made tweaks to suit this lab. i fixed this by trying to rewrite the code and updating github + the server. </p>
